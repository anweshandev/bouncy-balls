## Introduction

The pandemic has forced us to live a new way. It introduced us with "remote" meetings i.e. video conferencing. It has a screen full of participants instead of a room. Most of these participants will try to keep a quiet environment. But frequently they have to participate with white noise. If your participants are kids, then keeping quiet is itself a challenge. Here I present you with an app, which listens to the volume ðŸ”Š and alerts the participant about the environment.
